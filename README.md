# Smart-Collections
A desktop JavaFX app that helps a student manage a small library of items (notes, PDFs, audio/video links, and quick text snippets). It supports: rich UI, responsive event handling/animations, persistent storage via binary/object I/O, recursive file import, and efficient in-memory structures (lists, stacks, queues/priority queues, sets, maps).
